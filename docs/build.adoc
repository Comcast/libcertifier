|=======
=== Build types

The project supports following build configurations (to be used as an argument for option `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=`):

- Release - build project with compiler optimization and without debug information
- Debug - build project with debug information
- asan - build with Address Sanitizer features for real-time address checking
- lsan - build with Address Sanitizer features for real-time memory leaks checking
- ubsan - build with Address Sanitizer features for real-time checking for undefined behavior

The default build type is `Debug`.

=== Examples

Cmake can be run from any directory, it requires only path (relative or absolute) to the source directory and makes a build directory with all executables where it runs.

With `OpenSSL` & Tests & Valgrind ready & Debug configuration

----
mkdir -p Debug
cd Debug
cmake .. -DENABLE_CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DENABLE_CMOCKA=OFF -DENABLE_MBEDTLS=OFF -DENABLE_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
----

With `mbedTLS` & Tests & ASAN configuration

----
mkdir -p asan
cd asan
cmake .. -DENABLE_CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DENABLE_CMOCKA=OFF -DENABLE_MBEDTLS=ON -DENABLE_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=asan
----

From the build directory (if -DENABLE_TESTS=ON)

. Type in `cmake --build . --target clean` or `make clean`
. Type in `cmake --build .` or `make`
. Type in `./certifierTests` to run the unit tests

Now, run the functional test.  This attempts to read in the device attestation certificate, creates an X509 token from it (for authentication) and makes an HTTPS call to certifier and creates a PKCS12 file with a public/private keypair and an X509 certificate.

`./test-fetch-cert-e2e.sh ./device-attestation-certificate.p12 changeit`
. There should be an `lrg` file in the build directory.  This is the created PKCS12 file.


=== Build Options

|=======
| *Name* | *Default Value* | *Description*
| ENABLE_MBEDTLS | OFF | Enables mbedTLS as the crypto provider.  Otherwise, OpenSSL is the default.
| ENABLE_TESTS | OFF | Build unit tests (requires CMocka or Unit to be used)
| ENABLE_CMOCKA | OFF | Unit testing framework to use.  If OFF, Unit (self-contained is used)
| ENABLE_CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE | OFF | Enable verbose nakefiles for debugging
|=======
=== Sanitizers

Address Sanitizer works in runtime always if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=asan` is chosen. 
Similar for Leakage Sanitizer (`lsan`) and Undefined Behavior sanitizer (`ubsan`).
Normally Sanitizer produces list of errors after the program finishes, 
but all these  errors have been fixed and there are no messages after that.
Remember that project built with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=asan` fails Valgrind
tests invoked with the command `ctest -T memcheck`.

=== Valgrind

Valgrind checks can be run on any tests added to `CMakeLists.txt` and runnable with `ctest` by the command

```
ctest -T memcheck
```

=== OSX

Building/running on OSX is a bit tricky.

==== Open SSL 1.1.1f

If you already have `openssl` version 1.1.1 or higher, you can skip this section.

In the Linux Ubuntu world, `openssl` is not the same as `libssl-dev`.  The first one is for direct use, the second is for linking.  On OSX, they are bundled in one package, if you use `brew install openssl` and there are some things you have to do to get it to work.  Also, OSX comes with their own version of OpenSSL, which makes things even more complicated, i.e., DLL hell (Windows joke!).

I prefer to compile and install OpenSSL on OSX myself.  Here is what I did, and may have be tuned for your particular env -

Step 1 - Get the source code for Open SSL 1.1.1f -

----
cd ~
curl --remote-name https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1f.tar.gz
----

Step 2 - Extract the archive and move into the folder -

----
tar -xzvf openssl-1.1.1f.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.1.1f
----

Step 3 - Configure, compile and install into `/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f`

The command below assumes you are using `64-Bit` OSX.

----
./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc shared enable-deprecated enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-comp --prefix=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f --openssldir=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f --api=1.0.0
make depend
make
sudo make install
----

If you are using `32-Bit` OSX -

----
./Configure darwin-i386-cc shared enable-deprecated no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-comp --prefix=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f --openssldir=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f --api=1.0.0
make depend
make
sudo make install
----

Notice that the `enable-deprecated` flag is enabled.  There are still places in our code,
openssl.c, where older APIs in 1.0.x were used.  They have been deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.1.  In the future, there should be a TODO to disable support for Open SSL 1.0.x and move to the supported APIs.

Step 5 - OpenSSL should be installed.

==== cURL 7.69.1

If you already have `curl` version 7.69.1 or higher, you can skip this section.

Just like OpenSSL, I prefer to compile and install cURL on OSX myself.  Here is what I did, and may have be tuned for your particular env -

Step 1 - Get the source code for cURL 7.69.1 -

----
cd ~
curl --remote-name https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.69.1.tar.gz
----

Step 2 - Extract the archive and move into the folder -

----
tar -xzvf curl-7.69.1.tar.gz
cd curl-7.69.1
----

Step 3 - Configure, compile and install into `/usr/local/mac-dev-env/curl-7.69.1`

----
./configure --with-darwinssl --prefix=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/curl-7.69.1
make
sudo make install
----

Notice the `--with-darwinssl` flag.  This uses OSX's built-in OpenSSL version and not the one we just built.  I prefer doing this, because it's easier.

If you have OpenSSL installed somewhere else (for example, /opt/OpenSSL) and you have pkg-config installed, set the pkg-config path first, like this:

----
env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/OpenSSL/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-ssl
----

Without pkg-config installed, use this:

----
./configure --with-ssl=/opt/OpenSSL
----

Step 5 - Now cURL should be installed.

Step 6 - Type the following command to see build output as shown below. Make sure output successfully finds openssl, curl and zlib

[source,console]
----
cmake .
-- Found OpenSSL: /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.dylib (found suitable version "1.1.1f", minimum required is "1.1.1")
-- Found ZLIB: /usr/lib/libz.dylib (found suitable version "1.2.11", minimum required is "1.2.11")
-- Found CURL: /usr/lib/libcurl.dylib (found suitable version "7.64.1", minimum required is "7.60")
-- Performing Test HAS_SSP
-- Performing Test HAS_SSP - Success
-- Stack smashing protection enabled
-- AddressSanitizer enabled (debug builds)
-- buildType:

-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /Users/ahaque201/Github/libcertifier
----

If the steps above fail, you can create a file, called `build.sh` with the following contents -

----
#!/bin/bash
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/openssl-1.1.1f
export CURL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/mac-dev-env/curl-7.69.1
export CFLAGS='-DOPENSSL_API_COMPAT=0x10000000L'
export CURL_INCLUDE_DIR=${CURL_ROOT_DIR}/include
export CURL_LIBRARY_RELEASE=${CURL_ROOT_DIR}/lib/libcurl.dylib
cmake . -DENABLE_MBEDTLS=OFF -DENABLE_CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DENABLE_CMOCKA=OFF -DENABLE_TESTS=ON -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=${OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR} -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=${OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR}/include -DCURL_INCLUDE_DIR=${CURL_INCLUDE_DIR} -DCURL_LIBRARY_RELEASE=${CURL_LIBRARY_RELEASE}
----

Please make sure the file is marked as executable `chmod 755 ./build.sh`.

Reference -

----
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/300979e7889b34d61803675c560fe450c7404447/Modules/FindOpenSSL.cmake

https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/300979e7889b34d61803675c560fe450c7404447/Modules/FindCURL.cmake
----

Then you can run it via `./build.sh` and then

```
make clean
```

followed by -

```
make
```

If you get symbols that cannot be referenced, it's most likely because something else is defined as in implicit include directory (like an older version of OpenSSL), such as ```/opt/local/include/openssl/``` so please be sure that older Open SSL include files do not exist.

#### cURL (alternative)
An alternative to building cURL is running the following -
----

brew install curl-openssl

----

#### mbedTLS
mbedTLS is more straightforward.

You could use ```brew install mbedtls``` to install.
