== Logging

libLedger() supports logging diagnostic information to a file.

If using libcertifier.cfg (or equivalent), the following properties could control logging -

----
   "libcertifier.log.level":0,
   "libcertifier.log.file":"/tmp/libcertifier.log",
   "libcertifier.log.max.size":5000000,
----

The configuration above specifies that verbose and above logging is enabled. Append mode would be enabled and all diagnostic messages would be written to /tmp/libcertifier.log.

NOTE: In the above example, 5 MB is the total max log size before /tmp/libcertifier.log gets renamed to /tmp/libcertifier.log.old

It you wanted to see HTTPS trace, do the following -

----
   "libledger.http.trace":1
